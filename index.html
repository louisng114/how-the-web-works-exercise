    <h2>Part One: Solidify Terminology</h2>
    <p>In your own terms, define the following terms:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>What is HTTP?</li>
        <p>Short for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is the protocol to communicate with servers.</p>

        <li>What is a URL?</li>
        <p>The language-based address of a website corresponded to IP addresses.</p>

        <li>What is DNS?</li>
        <p>Short of Domain Name System. It is the way the internet translate between URL and IP addresses.</p>

        <li>What is a query string?</li>
        <p>Part of an URL. It is located at the end of an URL for additional parameters.</p>

        <li>What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?</li>
        <p>Two HTTP verbs are GET and POST. THey are both requests. GET takes information and does not change data on the server side. POST sends data to a server.</p>

        <li>What is an HTTP request?</li>
        <p>Something the user asks a server to do.</p>

        <li>What is an HTTP response?</li>
        <p>The response from a HTTP request</p>

        <li>What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.</li>
        <p>Specific details of a request/response. Some examples of request headers are authority, method, and accept-language. Some examples of response headers are content-type, date, status, and server.</p>

        <li>What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?</li>
        <p>The browser translates the URL into and IP address with the DNS. A request for the content is sent to the server with the IP address. The server decides what to do and sends back a response. Base on the response, the browser displays a web page.</p>
    </ul>
